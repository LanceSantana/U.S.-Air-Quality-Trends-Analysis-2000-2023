Calculating Summary Statistics, Filtering Data, and Comparing Values Without Using Charts

Average Pollutant Levels by State

Question: What are the average levels of each pollutant (O3, CO, SO2, NO2) for each state?
Task: Calculate the mean values of O3 Mean, CO Mean, SO2 Mean, and NO2 Mean for each state to compare average pollution levels across states.
Identifying the Most Polluted Year

Question: Which year had the highest average AQI across all pollutants?
Task: Calculate the annual average of O3 AQI, CO AQI, SO2 AQI, and NO2 AQI, and identify the year with the highest combined AQI values.
Top Cities with High Pollutant Peaks

Question: Which cities have the highest recorded peak values for each pollutant?
Task: Find the maximum values for O3 1st Max Value, CO 1st Max Value, SO2 1st Max Value, and NO2 1st Max Value, listing the corresponding cities.
Count of High AQI Days by Pollutant

Question: How many days have AQI levels over 100 for each pollutant across the dataset?
Task: Filter the dataset for days where O3 AQI, CO AQI, SO2 AQI, or NO2 AQI exceed 100 and count occurrences for each pollutant.
Yearly Improvement or Worsening of AQI

Question: Has the average AQI for each pollutant improved or worsened over time?
Task: Calculate the difference in average AQI values between the first and last year for O3 AQI, CO AQI, SO2 AQI, and NO2 AQI to determine overall trends.
