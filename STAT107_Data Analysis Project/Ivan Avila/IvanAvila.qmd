## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

Packages installed

```{r}
install.packages("maps")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Libraries Used

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(maps)
```

```{r}
airquality_data <- read_csv("/Users/ivana/Downloads/Stats_107R/Stats107_Project/pollution_2000_2023.csv")
```

Question: Which states have the highest average levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) AQI?

Task: Create a map highlighting states by their average NO2 AQI levels to visualize geographical patterns in pollution.

```{r}
state_avg_NO2 <- airquality_data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(Avg_NO2_AQI = mean(`NO2 AQI`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(State = tolower(State))


map_data_states <- map_data("state")

avg_NO2_merged_states <- map_data_states %>%
  left_join(state_avg_NO2, by = c("region" = "State"))

ggplot(avg_NO2_merged_states, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Avg_NO2_AQI)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Average NO2 AQI by State",
       fill = "Avg_NO2_AQI") 

  

```

Question: How have NO2 levels changed over time in a selected city? Task: Filter for a specific city and plot a line chart of NO2 Mean by year. Comparing Max Values of Pollutants

```{r}

```
